A library for installing Blesta extensions using [composer](http://getcomposer.org).

## Usage

To use simply add `blesta/composer-installer` as a requirement to your extension's `composer.json` file.

```sh
composer require blesta/composer-installer:~1.0
```

Now list your extension with packagist (the default composer repository) and anyone can install your extension with composer!
